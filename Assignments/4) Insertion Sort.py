# Insertion sort how does it work?
# -------------------------------------------------------
# It works similarly to the way people often sort playing cards in their hands. 
# -------------------------------------------------------
# Here's how it works step-by-step:
# 1. Start with the second element of the array (the first element is considered sorted).
# 2. Compare the current element with the elements in the sorted portion (to its left).
# 3. Shift all elements in the sorted portion that are greater than the current element to the right.
# 4. Insert the current element into its correct position in the sorted portion.
